## Universal Syntax Highlighting Function

The function itself is miniscule, only ~1767 bytes~ minified. (ushf-min.js)
The language definitions are also quite brief, they are stored in ~lang/~.
Styles are available for the languages defined in ~style/~,
Though many languages are lumped into a handful of CSS files as they are so
small.
